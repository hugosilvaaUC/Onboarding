    <h2>Welcome to our tech support onboarding page!</h2>
    <p>
      This page is designed to help newly tech support staff get up to speed on
      our products and services, as well as test their technical skills and
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>We'll start with an introduction to our products and services.</p>
    <p>
      Our organization provides a range of products and services, and it's
      important for our tech support staff to have a good understanding of each
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll explain the technology behind each product and service, so you can
      better understand how they work and how to troubleshoot issues that may
      arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next, we have a series of exercises that will test your technical skills
      and product knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      These exercises are designed to simulate common technical issues that
      customers may face.
    </p>
    <p>
      You'll be required to troubleshoot and resolve each issue, so you can
      practice your problem-solving skills and develop a better understanding of
      our products.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've included a wide range of scenarios to ensure that you're
      well-equipped to handle any technical issue that comes your way.
    </p>
    <p>
      From basic troubleshooting to more complex issues, these exercises will
      help you become a more confident and capable tech support member.
    </p>
    <p>
      These elements will reinforce the key concepts and skills covered in the
      exercises, and provide a more fun and engaging learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the onboarding page, you'll have a strong understanding of
      our products and services, as well as the technical skills needed to
      provide excellent tech support to our customers.
    </p>
    <p>
